        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          At the heart of my journey in technology, I believe in continuous
          growth, innovation, and making a tangible impact. From building robust
          applications to solving complex challenges, my work reflects a passion
          for creating efficient, scalable solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether it's developing a marketplace app using
          <strong>React Native</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong> or
          implementing secure communication with advanced
          <strong>ML models</strong>, I approach every project with a mindset to
          learn and grow. I thrive on tackling problems and finding the simplest
          yet most effective ways to solve them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Collaboration, respect, and inclusivity are essential to my work
          ethic. Through my experiences‚Äîfrom internships to competitive coding
          contests‚ÄîI‚Äôve learned that success is not just about individual effort
          but also about building connections, gaining new perspectives, and
          pushing boundaries. I'm driven by curiosity and committed to unlocking
          the potential in every challenge I face.
